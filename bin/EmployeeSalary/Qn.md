# Employee Class

## Problem Description

Create a class called `Employee` that includes three instance variables:

- **firstName** (type `String`)
- **lastName** (type `String`)
- **monthlySalary** (type `double`)

Provide the following:

1. A constructor that initializes the three instance variables.
2. Set and get methods for each instance variable.
3. A condition that ensures the monthly salary is only set if it's positive (i.e., if the monthly salary is not positive, do not set its value).

Then, write a test application named `EmployeeTest` that demonstrates the capabilities of the `Employee` class. The test app should:

1. Create two `Employee` objects.
2. Display each object's yearly salary.
3. Give each `Employee` a 10% raise.
4. Display each object's yearly salary again after the raise.
